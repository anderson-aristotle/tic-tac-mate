# Tic Tac Toe!

A online version of the class tic tac toe game! Play against someone at the same terminal or play against yourself! Sign up and sign in are required to play; win detection and game statistis are provided for you.

## Getting Started

Simply go to , sign up, and sign in.

## Technologies used

+ HTML
+ CSS + SASS
+ Javascript + jQuery
+ Bootstrap
+ highlight.js

## Planning and Development

Planning:
1. Start coding
2. Refactor and complete small goals that lead upto a big goal
3. After making progress, go back and check if what was done makes anything on the to-do list


#### My Process

1. Start coding
2. Build HTML
2. Complete auth event handlers by copying from previous auth folder with same ideas
3. Complete game event handlers except PATCH
4. Complete onUpdateGame
5. Refactor into smaller files, more folders
6. Build game logic
7. Refactor game logic
8. Refactor client-side files
9. Add secrets
10. Add view onPageLoad handlers
11. Refactor game logic into its own folder
12. Add bootstrap navbar, nav dropdowns
13. Refactor into smaller files, more folders
14. Add logic Demonstration
15. Receive feedback and update
16. Fill in ReadME

#### Initial wireframes and user stories
##### 

1. As a user, I want to sign up.
2. As a user, I want to sign in.
3. As a user, I want to change passwords.
4. As a user, I want to sign out.
5. As a user, I want to play a new game.
6. As a user, I want to see previous games.
7. As a user, I want to go to a previous game.
8. As a user, I want to see how the code works.
9. As a user, I want to see a demonstration of the code.

## Problem Solving Strategy

1. Break down problems into smallest solvable problem and build up.
2. Take a break after certain amount of time regardless of progress.
3. Write down diagrams if stuck.
4. Explain code to peers for different approaches to solve the problem.

## Unsolved Problems

1. Logic Solution Demo Right Pane check exceeds the height of the flexbox, need the parent container to grow
2. Sometimes Main Board does not show up on load
3. Sometimes secret boxes scaling fails
4. background repeat gradient -> underneath black background

## Future Direction (Super Stretch Goals)

1. Possible features and directions this project could go:
2. Play any multiple games at same time
3. Dumb AI
4. MiniMax AI
5. Multiplayer
6. Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
